    <section title="Definitions">
      
      <t>Network function virtualization is defined
      in Wikipedia as follows:<list style="empty">

      <t>"Network function virtualization or NFV is a network architecture
      concept that uses the technologies of IT virtualization to
      virtualize entire classes of network node functions into
      building blocks that may connect, or chain together, to create
      communication services.</t>

      <t>NFV relies upon, but differs from, traditional server-virtualization
      techniques, such as those used in enterprise IT. A virtualized network
      function, or VNF, may consist of one or more virtual machines running
      different software and processes, on top of standard high-volume
      servers, switches and storage devices, or even cloud computing
      infrastructure, instead of having custom hardware appliances for each
      network function."</t></list></t>

      <t>The related term slicing has been used to describe a
      virtualization concept in planned 5G networks. The 3GPP
      architecture specification <xref target="TS-3GPP.23.501"/>
      defines network slices as having potentially different
      "supported features and network functions optimisations", and
      spanning functions from core network to radio access
      networks.</t>

    <section title="Observations">

	<t hangText="Software vs. Protocols"><vspace blankLines="1"/>

	Many of the necessary tools for using virtualization
	are software, e.g., tools that enable running processes or
	entire machines in a virtual environment decoupled from physical
	machines and isolated from each other, virtual switches that
	connect systems together, management tools to set up virtual
	environments, and so on. From a communications perspective these
	tools operate largely in the same fashion as their real-world
	counterparts do, except that there may not be wires or other
	physical communication channels, and that connections can be
	made in the desired fashion. <vspace blankLines="1"/>
	
	In general, there is no reason for protocols to change just
	because a function or a connection exists on a virtual platform.
	However, sometimes there are useful underlying
	technologies that facilitiate connection to virtualized systems,
	or optimised or additional tools that are needed in the the
	virtualized environment. <vspace blankLines="1"/>
      
	For instance, many underlying technologies enable
	virtualization at hardware or physical networking level. For
	instance, Ethernet networks have Virtual LAN (VLAN) tags and
	mobile networks have a choice of Access Point Names
	(APNs). These techniques allow users and traffic to be put on
	specific networks, which in turn may comprise of virtual
	components. <vspace blankLines="1"/>
	
	Other examples of protocols providing helpful techniques
	include virtual private networking mechanisms or management
	mechanisms and data models that can assist in setting up and
	administering virtualized systems.</t>
	
	<t hangText="Centralization of Functions"><vspace blankLines="1"/>

	An interesting architectural trend is that virtualization and 
	data/software driven networking technologies are driving
	network architectures where functionality moves towards
	central entities such as various controllers, path computation
	servers, and orchestration systems. <vspace blankLines="1"/>

	A natural consequence of this is the simplification (and
	perhaps commoditization) of network elements, while the
	"intelligent" or higher value functions migrate to the
	center.  <vspace blankLines="1"/>

	The benefits are largely in the manageability, control,
	and speed of change. There are, however, potential
	pitfalls to be aware of as well. First off, networks
	need to continue to be operate even under partial
	connectivity situations and breakage, and it is key that
	designs can handle those situations as well. And
	it is important that network users and peers
	continue to be able to operate and connect in
	the way that best suits them.</t>
