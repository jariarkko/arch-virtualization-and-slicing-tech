      <t>Network virtualization or slicing is network management
      pertaining to treating different traffic categories in separate
      virtual networks, with independent resource, technology, and
      topology choices. This document reviews IETF technologies
      that can be useful for network virtualization, such as those
      in Internet, Routing, and OPS areas.</t>

      <t>An understanding of what current technologies there exist and
      what they can or cannot do is the first step in developing
      plans for possible extensions. Nevertheless, it should be
      noted from the outset that there is a considerable toolset for
      at leas some of the tasks associated with virtualization or slicing.</t>
