    <section title="Introduction">

      <t>Network virtualization is network management
      pertaining to treating different traffic categories in separate
      virtual networks, with independent resource, technology, and
      topology choices. Network function virtualization is defined
      in Wikipedia as follows:<list style="empty">

      <t>"Network function virtualization or NFV is a network architecture
      concept that uses the technologies of IT virtualization to
      virtualize entire classes of network node functions into
      building blocks that may connect, or chain together, to create
      communication services.</t>

      <t>NFV relies upon, but differs from, traditional server-virtualization
      techniques, such as those used in enterprise IT. A virtualized network
      function, or VNF, may consist of one or more virtual machines running
      different software and processes, on top of standard high-volume
      servers, switches and storage devices, or even cloud computing
      infrastructure, instead of having custom hardware appliances for each
      network function."</t></list></t>

      <t>The related term slicing has been used to describe a
      virtualization concept in planned 5G networks.</t>

      <t>Many of the necessary tools for using virtualization
      are software, e.g., tools that enable running processes or
      entire machines in a virtual environment decoupled from physical
      machines and isolated from each other, virtual switches that
      connect systems together, management tools to set up virtual
      environments, and so on. From a communications perspective these
      tools operate largely in the same fashion as their real-world
      counterparts do, except that there may not be wires or other
      physical communication channels, and that connections can be
      made in the desired fashion.</t>

      <t>In general, there is no reason for protocols to change just
      because a function or a connection exists on a virtual platform.
      However, sometimes there are useful underlying
      technologies that facilitiate connection to virtualized systems,
      or optimised or additional tools that are needed in the the
      virtualized environment.</t>
      
      <t>For instance, many underlying technologies enable
      virtualization at hardware or physical networking level. For
      instance, Ethernet networks have Virtual LAN (VLAN) tags and mobile networks
      have a choice of Access Point Names (APNs). These techniques
      allow users and traffic to be put on specific networks, which in
      turn may comprise of virtual components.</t>

      <t>For a lot of the cases, there is no need for the protocols
      to be different in these environments. </t>
      
      <t>This document reviews IETF technologies
      that can be useful for network virtualization, such as those
      in Internet, Routing, and OPS areas.</t>

      <t>An understanding of what current technologies there exist and
      what they can or cannot do is the first step in developing
      plans for possible extensions. Nevertheless, it should be
      noted from the outset that there is a considerable toolset for
      at least some of the tasks associated with virtualization or slicing.</t>
