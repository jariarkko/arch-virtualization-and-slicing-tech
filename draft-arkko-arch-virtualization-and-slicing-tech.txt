      Tools for the Support of Network Virtualization and Slicing
            draft-arkko-arch-virtualization-and-slicing-tech

Abstract

   Network virtualization or slicing is network management pertaining to
   treating different traffic categories in separate virtual networks,
   with independent resource, technology, and topology choices.  This
   document reviews IETF technologies that can be useful for network
   virtualization, such as those in Internet, Routing, and OPS areas.

   An understanding of what current technologies there exist and what
   they can or cannot do is the first step in developing plans for
   possible extensions.  Nevertheless, it should be noted from the
   outset that there is a considerable toolset for at leas some of the
   tasks associated with virtualization or slicing.

1.  Introduction

   Network virtualization or slicing is network management pertaining to
   treating different traffic categories in separate virtual networks,
   with independent resource, technology, and topology choices.  This
   document reviews IETF technologies that can be useful for network
   virtualization, such as those in Internet, Routing, and OPS areas.

   An understanding of what current technologies there exist and what
   they can or cannot do is the first step in developing plans for
   possible extensions.  Nevertheless, it should be noted from the
   outset that there is a considerable toolset for at least some of the
   tasks associated with virtualization or slicing.
