          Considerations on Network Virtualization and Slicing
                    draft-arkko-arch-virtualization

Abstract

   Network virtualization is network management pertaining to treating
   different traffic categories in separate virtual networks, with
   independent resource, technology, and topology choices.

   This document makes some observations on the effects virtualization
   on Internet architecture.  A further revision of this document will
   also provide a summary of IETF technologies that relate to network
   virtualization.  An understanding of what current technologies there
   exist and what they can or cannot do is the first step in developing
   plans for possible extensions.

1.  Introduction

   Network virtualization is network management pertaining to treating
   different traffic categories in separate virtual networks, with
   independent resource, technology, and topology choices.

   This document makes some observations on the effects virtualization
   on Internet architecture.

   A further revision of this document will also provide a summary of
   IETF technologies that relate to network virtualization.  An
   understanding of what current technologies there exist and what they
   can or cannot do is the first step in developing plans for possible
   extensions.

2.  Definitions

   Network function virtualization is defined in Wikipedia as follows:

      "Network function virtualization or NFV is a network architecture
      concept that uses the technologies of IT virtualization to
      virtualize entire classes of network node functions into building
      blocks that may connect, or chain together, to create
      communication services.

      NFV relies upon, but differs from, traditional server-
      virtualization techniques, such as those used in enterprise IT.  A
      virtualized network function, or VNF, may consist of one or more
      virtual machines running different software and processes, on top
      of standard high-volume servers, switches and storage devices, or
      even cloud computing infrastructure, instead of having custom
      hardware appliances for each network function."

   The related term slicing has been used to describe a virtualization
   concept in planned 5G networks.  The 3GPP architecture specification
   [TS-3GPP.23.501] defines network slices as having potentially
   different "supported features and network functions optimisations",
   and spanning functions from core network to radio access networks.

   [I-D.king-teas-applicability-actn-slicing] defined slicing as "an
   approach to network operations that builds on the concept of network
   abstraction to provide programmability, flexibility, and modularity.
   It may use techniques such as Software Defined Networking (SDN) and
   Network Function Virtualization (NFV) to create multiple logical
   (virtual) networks, each tailored for a set of services that are
   sharing the same set of requirements, on top of a common network.

3.  Observations

   Software vs. Protocols

      Many of the necessary tools for using virtualization are software,
      e.g., tools that enable running processes or entire machines in a
      virtual environment decoupled from physical machines and isolated
      from each other, virtual switches that connect systems together,
      management tools to set up virtual environments, and so on.  From
      a communications perspective these tools operate largely in the
      same fashion as their real-world counterparts do, except that
      there may not be wires or other physical communication channels,
      and that connections can be made in the desired fashion.

      In general, there is no reason for protocols to change just
      because a function or a connection exists on a virtual platform.
      However, sometimes there are useful underlying technologies that
      facilitiate connection to virtualized systems, or optimised or
      additional tools that are needed in the the virtualized
      environment.

      For instance, many underlying technologies enable virtualization
      at hardware or physical networking level.  For instance, Ethernet
      networks have Virtual LAN (VLAN) tags and mobile networks have a
      choice of Access Point Names (APNs).  These techniques allow users
      and traffic to be put on specific networks, which in turn may
      comprise of virtual components.

      Other examples of protocols providing helpful techniques include
      virtual private networking mechanisms or management mechanisms and
      data models that can assist in setting up and administering
      virtualized systems.

   Centralization of Functions

      An interesting architectural trend is that virtualization and data
      /software driven networking technologies are driving network
      architectures where functionality moves towards central entities
      such as various controllers, path computation servers, and
      orchestration systems.

      A natural consequence of this is the simplification (and perhaps
      commoditization) of network elements, while the "intelligent" or
      higher value functions migrate to the center.

      The benefits are largely in the manageability, control, and speed
      of change.  There are, however, potential pitfalls to be aware of
      as well.  First off, networks need to continue to be operate even
      under partial connectivity situations and breakage, and it is key
      that designs can handle those situations as well.  And it is
      important that network users and peers continue to be able to
      operate and connect in the way that best suits them.

   Tailored vs. general-purpose networking

      The interest in building tailored solutions, tailored Quality-of-
      Service offerings vs. building general-purpose "low touch"
      networks seems to fluctuate over time.

      It is important to find the right balance here.  From an economics
      perspective, it may not be feasible to provide specialised service
      -- at least if it requires human effort -- for large fraction of
      use cases.  Even if those are very useful in critical
      applications.
